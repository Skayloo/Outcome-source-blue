# Why this exists rather than putting `turn:` straight in the config: livekit-server EXITS —
# "TURN tls cert required" — when turn.enabled is set and the file is missing. That is the
# normal state of a first boot, before Caddy has finished issuing, and of any boot where DNS
# for the turn host has not been pointed yet. Refusing to start would take voice down
# completely in order to add a fallback path to it, which is the wrong way round.
#
# So: certificate present → TURN on. Absent → a line in the log and voice as before.

# forward them, silently. LiveKit both listens on this and advertises it to clients, so the
# external and internal port have to be the same number.

# still publishes the port, and the only symptom is that nothing is listening behind it.
